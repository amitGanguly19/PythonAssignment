## Assignment Part-1

Q1. Why do we call Python a general-purpose and high-level programming language?
Python is a general-purpose programming language as it is built for a wide variety of application domains. It’s designed to be used in many applications like data science, web development, automation, etc.
It’s a high-level programming language as it emphasizes code readability with significant indentation. It is dynamically typed and garbage–collected. It incorporates modules, exceptions, and classes. It is interpreted, interactive, procedural, and functional.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Python is dynamically typed which means that variable types are determined and checked at runtime rather than during compilation. It doesn’t need to explicitly declare the variable type before using it.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Q4. In what domains can we use Python?
Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Computing, Networking and Web development. 

Q5. What are variables and how can we declare them?
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
We can take input by using the INPUT function which is INPUT () from the user.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
By default, input returns a string.

Q8. What is type casting?
A method used to change the variable values declared in a certain data type into different data types to match the operation required to be performed by the code snippet.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why? 
IN python user can take multiple values or inputs in one line by using split () method.

Q10. What are keywords?
These are predefined and reserved words which cant be used as on identifier, function and variable name.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
NO

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Indentation means spaces in code line. It there to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
By using Print () function. It prints the message to the screen.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Operators are specific symbols that indicate that some sort of computation should be performed. The value of an operator is called operands.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
/ Operators used for float division and // is for integer division.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
name – “iNeuron” * 3
print(name)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

number = int (input("Enter a number = "))
if number % 2 :
     print("Number is Even")
else:
     print("Number is Odd")


Q18. What are boolean operator?
These operators are result in the Boolean values of True and False. These include and, or and not.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 =1
a = 1 or 0
print(a) 
0 and 0 = 0
a = 0 and 0
print(a) 

True and False and True = False
a = True and False and True
print(a) 

1 or 0 or 0 =1
a = 1 or 0 or 0
print(a) 

```
Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Statements like if , else and elif constructs that allow to control the flow of the program based on condition that is specified. They provide a way to make a decision.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
These are conditional statements which provide in decision making that is required to execute code based on particular conditions. It helps to automate that decision process.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
age = int (input("Enter your age = "))

if age >= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")   


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
